    File: train_pipeline.py
        -Will prep data, Initiate forest and output submission file. Initiates entire program.
    File: RandomForest.py
        -Will create the RandomForest based on given paramters from train_pipeline, and 
        will initiate decision trees and give prediction based on majority vote from DTs.
    File: DecisionTree.py
        -Initiates tree based on given paramters from RandomForest, will output a prediction.
